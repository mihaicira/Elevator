# Elevator
# I've created this app in highschool, in 2018.
# The app requires an amount of people who enter in the elevator, and then for each of them - the floor they want to go to.
# Then it's just about the graphic: up in left is elevator's status, and then the elevator itself, and after that, the floors themselves.
# There is a small symbol at each floor, moving between them. After all people arrived at their floors, the elevator closes and goes to floor 0.
